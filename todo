# Perflang
modular (go, haskell)
functional (enchilada, haskell)
concanative (forth, joy)
staticaly compiled with a jit compiler (see fujujima)
whole program compilation optimization
rewriting rules (dup drop)
static type system, type inference
tail recursion (scheme, colorforth)
self-hosted (smalltalk) (find a way to export individual applications)
continued fractions or other symbolic arithmetic
types of specific size (1, 2, 3, 4, 8 bytes)
block memory allocation, with pools
unicode strings
each fun has a signature which indicates if the fun is pure or can be runned out of order. When calling the fun you can use another signature to change the default one.
instead of lazy evaluation, combine multiple functions and do a single pass application: e.g. [1 2 3] (+3) map (+2) map -> [1 2 3] (+5) map
no modules export functions
a lang is used for: parsing, image manipulation, matrixes,
